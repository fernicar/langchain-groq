**Comprehensive Guide to Story Development: From Premise to Final Chapters**

---

### **Notes:**
- This document outlines a structured, step-by-step approach to crafting a story, from brainstorming the premise to writing detailed chapters, specifically designed for use with Large Language Models (LLMs).
- It leverages LLM capabilities to assist with:
  - Generating premises, endings, and synopses.
  - Creating genre-based structures and detailed outlines.
  - Developing Character Profiles with user input and additional prompts.
  - Producing story bits enriched with narrative details.
  - Crafting style and writing prompts to shape tone, genre, and point of view.
- The method supports iterative interaction with LLMs, enabling writers to refine and personalize their creative process at every stage.
- Intended to maximize the potential of LLMs, this guide encourages users to adjust prompts and outputs to align with their unique story vision and goals.

#1) Brainstorm the premise/ending
   - Start with a novel concept or motif.
   - Create a competition of premises (optional: include style notes or themes as a group).
   - From the selected premise, develop a competition of endings.

   The outcome becomes the synopsis.

#2) From the synopsis and story information:
   - Create a detailed synopsis based on the genre (choose one) and the traditional three-act structure (or another structure).
   - Refine the detailed synopsis to suit your preferences before continuing.

   Note: The detailed synopsis and structure do not yet include the outline. You’ll need to specify this in the next step.

#3) From the synopsis and structure:
   - Generate an outline as:
     - A detailed summary of the story (enriched with additional details).
     - Separated into segments using a chosen method (e.g., Hero's Journey).

   Edit the detailed summary again to suit your taste before moving forward.

#4) Create character prompts (optional):
   - Provide information about any character (e.g., Protagonist, Antagonist, Mentor, etc.).
   - Ask for additional details to build a Character Profile.
   - Refine and edit the generic aspects as needed.

#5) Develop story bits for all chapters, one at a time:
   - Create scripts for specific story action bits, enriched with additional story information relevant to each bit. This method enhances the characters.
   - Use proper nouns and minimize pronouns for clarity.

   Take time to edit out anything you don’t like in the chapter bits.

#6) Style prompt (complex and decisive instructions):
   - Craft a system prompt that automatically precedes each interaction with the language model.
   - Edit or refine the numbered prompts to suit your specific taste and requirements.

#7) Prose prompt (guidance for chapter writing):
   - Define the requirements for each chapter, such as:
     - Genre: e.g., epic fantasy.
     - Tone: e.g., dark.
     - Point of view: first-person or third-person (limited/onminicent). specify if not included in the system prompt.
     - Setting: detail the location, time period, and environment in which the bits story takes place.
     - Key characters: ensure certain characters, such as the protagonist, are included.
     - Story beats: choose 3 and include them in the chapter.

   Repeat the process for every bits and chapter as needed.
